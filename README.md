- The detailed report is sent to the patient's email, and stored in MongoDB.
- All our data in MongoDB is backed up in our decentralised IPFS web3 storage.
- Google Maps API has been used for showing the nearest eye hospital as a suggestion to the patient, based on the current location of the user.
- If the patient has any queries, they can get the required answers through our chatbot on our web-app.
